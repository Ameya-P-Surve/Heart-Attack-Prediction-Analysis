# Heart Attack Prediction Analysis with Health and Lifestyle Data
#### Exploring the Critical Factors Behind Heart Attack Risks

In the realm of healthcare and wellness, understanding the underlying factors that contribute to heart attacks is paramount for both prevention and early diagnosis. This project leverages a comprehensive dataset to analyze various health and lifestyle indicators that may influence the likelihood of heart attacks, focusing on crucial metrics like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, and other key variables.

The dataset, includes 372,974 rows and 32 columns, capturing a wide range of factors that contribute to heart attack risks. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations between these variables and heart attack occurrences, with the intention of promoting better heart health awareness and prevention strategies.

Our analysis pipeline includes thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), advanced feature engineering (including handling of missing values and encoding), and the application of classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifier to predict the likelihood of heart attacks based on the dataset's health and lifestyle factors.

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights that can assist healthcare professionals and organizations in understanding the risk factors of heart attacks, thereby fostering more informed decisions for heart health management and ultimately saving lives.
